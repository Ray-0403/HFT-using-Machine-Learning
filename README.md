# HFT-using-Machine-Learning
My first high-frequency trading strategy using machine learning

i used 1 month of 1 second high frequency ES futures data with 30 levels of order book data to train and test the model. PCA and supervised autoencoder are used to compress the features, and lightgbm is used to train the finanl model.
